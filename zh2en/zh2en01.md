### “中庸思想”是儒家思想的核心内容。
### The Doctrine of the Mean is the core of Confucianism.

### 孔子所谓的“中”不是指“折中”，而是指在认识和处理客观事物时的一种“适度”和“恰如其分”的方法。
### The so-called "mean" by Confucius does not mean "compromise" but a "moderate" and "just-right" way when understanding and handling objective things.

### 孔子主张不仅要把这种思想作为一种认识和处理事物的方法来看待，而且还应该通过自身修养和锻炼，把它融入自己的日常行为当中，使之成为一种美德。
### Confucius advocated that this thought should not only be treated as a way to understand and deal with things but also be integrated into one's daily conduct to make it a virtue through self-cultivation and training.

### 中庸思想是儒家思想的核心，也是中国传统文化的重要组成部分。
### The Doctrine of the Mean is not only the core of Confucianism but also an important component of traditional Chinese culture.
