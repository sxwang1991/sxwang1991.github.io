## Part III.	Reading Comprehension (50 minutes, 30 points) 

* Directions:

 There are 6 passages in this part. Each passage is followed by some questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. You should decide on the best choice and write your answer on the Answer Sheet.

One day in 1963, a dolphin named Elvar and a famous astronomer, Carl Sagan, were playing a little game. The astronomer was visiting an institute which was looking into the way dolphins communicate with each other. He was standing at the edge of one of the tanks where several of these highly intelligent, friendly creatures were kept. Elvar had just swum up alongside hiui,and had turned on his back. He wanted Sagan to scratch his stomach again, as the astronomer had done twice before. But this time Elvar was too deep in the water for Sagan to reach him. Elvar looked up at Sagan, waiting. Then, after a minute or so, the dolphin leapt up through the water into the air and made a sound just like the word `More?'

The astonished astronomer went -to the director of the institute and told him about the incident.

`Oh, yes: That's one of the words he knows,' the director said, showing no surprise at all.

Dolphins have bigger brains in proportion to their body size than humans have, andit has been known for a long time that they can make a number o€ sounds. What is more, these sounds seem to have different functions, such as warning each other of danger. Sound travels much faster ,and much further in water than it does in air. That is why the parts of the brain that deal with sound are much better developed in dolphins than in humans. But can it be said that dolphins have a `language' in the real sense of the word? Scientists don't agree on this.

A language is not just a collection of sounds, or even words. A language has a structure, or what we call a grammar. The grammar of a language helps to give it meaning. For example, the two questions `Who loves Mary?' and `Who does Mary love?' mean different things. If you stop to think about it, you will see that this difference doesn't come from the words in the question but from the difference in structure. That is why the question `Can dolphins speak?' can't be answered until we find out if dolphins not only make sounds but also arrange them in ways which affect their meaning.

### 71. The dolphin leapt into the air because 
* A) Sagan had turned his back
* B) it was part of the game they were playing
* C) he wanted Sagan to scratch him again
* D) Sagan wanted him to do this

### 72. When Sagan told the director about what the dolphin had done, the director
* A) didn't seem to think it was unusual
* B) thought Sagan was joking
* C) told Sagan about other words the dolphin knew
* D) asked him if he knew other words

### 73. Dolphins' brains are particularly well-developed to
* A) help them to travel fast in water
* B) arrange sounds in different structures
* C) respond to different kinds of sound
* D) communicate with humans through sound

### 74. The sounds we call words can be called a language only if
* A) each sound has a different meaning
* B) each sound is different from the other
* C) there is a system of writing
* D) they have a structure or grammar

Married people live "happily ever after" in fairy tales, but they do so less and less often in real life. 1, like many of my friends, got married, divorced, and remarried. I suppose, to some people, I'm a failure. After all, I broke my first solemn promise to "love and cherish until death us do part." But I feel that I'm finally a success. I learned from the mistakes I made in my first marriage. This time around, the ways my husband and I share our free time, make decisions, and deal with problems are very different.

I learned, first of all, not to be a clinging vine (依赖男子的妇女) . In my first marriage, I felt the every moment we spent apart was wasted. If Ray wanted to go out to a bar with his friends to watch a football game, I felt rejected and talked him into staying home. I wouldn't accept an offer to go to a movie or join an exercise class it' it meant that Ray would be home alone. I realize now that we were often angry with each other just because we spent too much time together. In contrast, my second husband and I spend some of our tree time apart and try to have interests of our own. I have started playing racquetball at a health club, and David sometimes takes off to go to the local auto races with his friends. When we are together, we aren't bored with each other; our separate interests make us more interesting people.

I learned not only to be apart sometimes but also to work together when it's time to make decisions. When Ray and I were married, I left all the important decisions to him. He decided how we would spend money, whether we should sell the car or fix it, and where to take a vacation. I know now that I went along with this so that I wouldn't have to take the responsibility when things went wrong. I could always end an argument by saying, "It was your fault!" With my second marriage, I am trying to be a full partner. We ask each other's opinions on major decisions and try to compromise if we disagree. If we make the wrong choice, we're equally guilty. When we rented an apartment, for example, we both had to take the blame for not noticing the drafty windows and the "no pets" clause in our lease.

Maybe the most important thing I've learned is to be a grown-up about facing problems. David and i have made a vow to face our troubles like adults. If we're mad at each other or worried and upset, we say how we feel. Rather than hide behind our own misery, we talk about the problem until we discover how to fix it. Everybody argues or has to deal with the occasional crisis, but Ray and I always reacted like children to these stormy times. I would lock myself in the spare bedroom. Ray would stalk out of the house, slam the door, and race off in the car. Then I would cry and worry till he returned.

I wish that my first marriage hadn't been the place where I learned how to make a relationship work, but at least I did learn. 1 feel better now about being an independent person, about making decisions, and about facing problems. My second marriage isn't perfect, but it doesn't have the deep flaws that made the first one fall apart.

### 75. Which of the following has contributed to the writer's divorce? 
* A) Her former husband went out to watch football games.
* B) She started to play racquetball at a health club.
* C) They spent too much time together and got bored with each other.
* D) They spent so little time together that they could not talk to each other.

* C) took more blame when things went wrong
* D) felt equally guilty when things went wrong

* A) "It was your fault!"

Classified Advertising is that advertising which is grouped in certain sections of the paper and is thus distinguished from display advertising. Such groupings as "Help Wanted", "Real Estate," "Lost and Found" are made, the rate charged being less than that for display advertising. Classified advertisements are a convenience to the reader and a saving to the advertiser. The reader who, is interested in a particular kind of advertisement finds all advertisements of that type grouped for him. The advertiser may, on this account, use a very small advertisement that would be lost if it were placed among larger advertisements in the paper.

It is evident that the reader approaches the classified advertisement in a different frame of mind from that in which he approaches the other advertisements in the paper. He turns to a page of classified advertisements to search for the particular advertisement that will meet his needs. As his attention is voluntary, the advertiser does not need to rely to much extent on display type to get the reader's attention.

Formerly all classified advertisements were of the same size and did not have display type. With the increase in the number of such advertisements, however, each advertiser within a certain group is vying with others in the same group for the reader's attention. In many cases the result has been an increase in the size of the space used and the addition of headlines and pictures. In that way the classified advertisement has in reality become a display advertisement. This is particularly true of realestate advertising.

### 81. Classified advertising is different to display advertising because
* A) all advertisements of a certain type are grouped together
* B) it is more distinguished
* C) it is more expensive
* D) nowadays the classified advertisements are all of the same size

### 82. One of the examples given of types of classified advertisement is
* A) house for sale
* B) people who are asking for help 
* C) people who are lost
* D) real antiques for sale

### 83. What sort of attitude do people have when they look at classified advertisements, according to the writer?
* A) They are in the frame of mind to buy anything. 
* B) They are looking for something they need.
* C) They feel lost because there are so many advertisements.
* D) They feel the same as when they look at display advertisements.

### 84. What does the writer say about the classified advertisements that used to be put in the papers?
* A) They used to be voluntary.
* B) They used to use display type.
* C) They were all the same size.
* D) They were more formal.

### 85. Why have classified advertisements changed in appearance, according to the writer?
* A) Because people no longer want headlines and pictures.
* B) Because real estate advertising is particularly truthful now.
* C） Because the increase in the number of such advertisements means they have to be smaller now.
* D) Because there are more advertisements now and more competition amongst advertisers. .

Mr Abu, the laboratory attendant, came in from the adjoining store and briskly cleaned the blackboard. He was a retired African sergeant from the Army Medical Corps and was feared by the boys. If he caught any of them in any petty thieving, he offered them the choice of a hard smack on the bottom or of being reported to the science masters. Most boys chose the former as they knew the matter would end there with no long interviews, moral arguments and an entry in the conduct book.

The science master, a man called Vernier, stepped in and stood on his small platform. Vernier set the experiments for the day and demonstrated them, then retired behind the "Church Times" which he read seriously in between walking quickly along the rows of laboratory benches, advising boys. It was a simple heat experiment to show that a dark surface gave out more heat by radiation than a bright surface.

During the class, Vernier was called away to the telephone and Abu was not about, having retired to the lavatory for a smoke. As soon as a posted guard announced that he was out of sight, minor pandemonium ('N k) broke out. Some of the boys raided the store. The wealthier ones took rubber tubing to make catapults and to repair bicycles, and helped themselves to chemicals for developing photographic films. The poorer boys, with a more determined aim, took only things of strict commercial interst which could be sold easily in the market. They emptied stuff into bottles in their pockets. Soda for making soap, magnesium sulphate for opening medicine, salt for cooking, liquid paraffin for women's hairdressing, and fine yellow iodoform powder much in demand for sprinkling on sores. Kojo objected mildly to all this. "Oh, shut up!" a few boys said. Sorie, a huge boy who always wore a fez indoors, commanded respect and some leadership in the class. He was gently drinking his favourite mixture of diluted alcohol and bicarbonate----which he called "gin and fizz"----from a beaker. "Look here, Kojo, you are getting out of hand. What do you think our parents pay taxes and school fees for? For us to enjoy----or to buy a new car every year for Simpson? " The other boys laughed. Simpson was the European headmaster, feared by the small boys, adored by the boys in the middle school, and liked, in a critical fashion, with reservations, by some of the senior boys and African masters. He had a passion for new motor-cars, buying one yearly.
"Come to think of it," Sorie continued to Kojo, "you must take something yourself, then we'll know we are safe," "Yes, you must," the other boys insisted. Kojo gave in and, unwillingly, took a little nitrate for some gunpowder experiments which he was carrying out at home. "Someone!" the look-out called.

The boys ran back to their seats in a moment. Sorie washed out his mouth, at the sink with some water. Mr Abu, the laboratory attendant, entered and observed the innocent expression on the faces of the whole class. He looked round fiercely and suspiciously, and then sniffed the air. It was a physics experiment, but the place smelled chemical. However, Vemier came in then. After asking if anyone was in difficulties, and finding that no one could in a moment think up anything, he retired to his chair and settled down to an article on Christian reunion.

### 86. The boys were afraid of Mr Abu because
* A) he had been an Army sergeant and had military ideas of discipline
* B) he reported them to the Science masters whenever he caught them petty thieving
* C) he was cruel
* D) he believed in strict discipline

### 87. When the boys were caught petty thieving, they usually chose to be beaten by Mr Abu because
* A) he gave them only one hard smack instead of the six from their teachers
* B) they did not want to get a bad reputation with their teachers
* C) they were afraid of their science masters
* D) his punishment was quicker than their teachers'

### 88. Some boys took chemicals like soda and iodoform powder because
* A) they liked to set up stalls in the marked and sell things, like traders
* B) they were too poor to buy things like soap and medicine
* C) they wanted money and could sell such things quickly
* D) they needed things like soap and medicine for sores

### 89. A big difference between Kojo and Sorie was that
* A) Kojo took chemicals for some useful experiment but Sorie only wasted his in making an alcoholic drink.
* B) Sorie was rich but Kojo was poor

Alison closed the door of her small flat and put down her briefcase. As usual, she had brought some work home from the travel agency. She wanted to have a quick bite to eat and then, after spending a few hours working, she was looking forward to watching television or listening to some music:.

She was just about to start preparing her dinner when there was a knock at the door. `Uli, no! Who on earth could that be?' she muttered to herself. She went to the door and opened it just wide enough to see who it was. A man of about sixty was standing there. It took her a moment before she realized who he was. He lived in the flat below. They had passed each other on the stairs once or twice, and had nodded to each other but never really spoken.

`Uh, sorry to bother you, but ...uh...there's something I'd like to talk to you about,' he mumbled. He had a long, thin face and two big front teeth that made him look rather like a rabbit. Alison hesitated, but then, opening the door wide, asked him to come in. It was then that she noticed the dog. She hated dogs----particularly big ones. This one was a very old, very fat bulldog. The man had already bone into her small living-room and, without being asked, he sat down on the sofa. The dog followed him in and climbed up on the sofa next to him, breathing heavily. She stared at it. It stared back.

The man coughed. `Uh, do you mind if I smoke?' he asked. Before she could ask him not to, he had taken out a cigarette and lit it.

`I'll tell you why I've come. I ...I hope you won't be offended but, well ...,' he began and then stopped. Suddenly his face went red. His whole body began to shake. Then another cough exploded from somewhere deep inside him. Still coughing, he took out a grey, dirty-looking handkerchief and spat into it. Afterwards he put the cigarette back into his mouth and inhaled deeply. As he did so, some ash fell on the carpet.

The man looked around the room. He seemed to have forgotten what he wanted to say. Alison glanced at her watch and wondered when he would get to the point. She waited.

'Nice place you've got here,' he said at last.

* A) ' I wish he wouldn't bring that dog in here.'
* B) `Oh, what a nice dog?'
* C) 'What's wrong with that poor dog?'
* D) 'I'm sure I've seen that dog before somewhere.'

### 94. What happened after the man asked if he could smoke? 
* A) Alison offended him by asking him not to.
* B) He went ahead without waiting for an answer. 
* C) He began to smoke but then put the cigarette out.

* D) She had done something to offend him.

Even in fresh water sharks hunt and kill. The Thresher shark, capable of lifting a small boat out of the water, has been sighted a mile inland on the Fowey River in Cornwall. Killer sharks swim rivers to reach Lake Nicaragua in Central America; they average one human victim each year.

Sewage and garbage attract sharks inland. When floods carry garbage to the rivers they provide a rich diet which sometimes stimulates an epidemic of shark attacks. Warm water generally provides shark food, and a rich diet inflames the shark's aggression.

In British waters sharks usually swim peacefully between ten and twenty miles offshore where warm water currents fatten mackerel and pilchards for their food. But the shark is terrifyingly unpredictable. One seaman was severely mauled ()jV) as far north as Wick in Scotland. Small boats have been attacked in the English Channel, Irish Sea and North Sea.

Most of the legends about sharks are founded in ugly fact. Even a relatively small shark ---- a 200 lb. 2ambesi----can sever a man's leg with one bite. Sharks have up to seven rows of teeth and as one front tooth is damaged or lost another moves forward to take its place. The shark never sleeps. Unlike most fish, it has no air bladder, and it must move constantly to avoid sinking. It is a primitive creature, unchanged for sixty million years of evolution. Its skin is without the specialised scales of a fish. Fully grown, it still has five pairs of separate gills like a three-week. human embryo.

But it is a brilliantly efficient machine. Its skin carries nerve endings which can detect vibrations from fish 'Moving several miles away. Its sense of smell, the function of most of its brain, can detect one part in 600,000 of tuna fish juice in water, or the blood of a fish or animal from a quarter of a male away. It is colour blind, and sees best in deep water, but it can distinguish shapes and patterns of light and shade easily. Once vibrations and smell have placed its prey the shark sees well enough to home in by vision for the last fifty feet.

The shark eats almost anything. It will gobble old tin cans and broken bottles as well as fish, animals and humans. Beer bottles, shoes, wrist watches, car number plates, overcoats and other sharks have been found in dead sharks. Medieval records tell of entire human corpses still encased in armour.

The United States military advice on repelling sharks is to stay clothed----sharks go for exposed flesh; especially the feet. Smooth swimming at the surface is essential. Frantic splashing will simply attract sharks, and dropping below the surface makes the swimmer an easy target. If the shark gets close, then is the time to kick, thrash and hit out. A-direct hit on the snout; gills. or eyes will drive away most sharks. The exception is the Great White shark. It simply kills you.

### 96. It is less common to find sharks iii
* A) salt water
* B) fresh water
* C) warm water
* D) deep water

* A) They prefer warm water to cold water.
* B) They see best in deep water.
* C) They are afraid of man.
* D) That is where their food is.

### 98. Why does the shark never stop moving? 
* A) It never sleeps.
